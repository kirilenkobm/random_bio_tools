# Random bio tools

Just a pile of random tools I wrote to operate with different biological data.
Will be gradually updated.

## Contents

- fasta_tools.py - different operations on fasta files
- codon_diff.py - shows numbers of (non-)/synonymous changes between two sequences
- codon_ali_quality_check.py - detect misalignments in codon alignments
- label.py - label a tree (for example, for HyPhy analysis)
- add add_gene_labels.py - tool to add gene names for each Ensembl ID in a text file
- bdb_to_stdout.py - show content of a berkeley DB file
- bed_to_seq.py - transform bed-12 annotation to a sequence
